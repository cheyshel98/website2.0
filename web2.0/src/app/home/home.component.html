                My name is Cheyenne and I’m a Little Rock based creative seeking a full time professional role. With a background that
                spans from technology to design, I am passionate about bringing these two skill sets together to create anything from
                beautiful and accessible websites to building out eye-catching branding materials. If there’s a design or development
                need for your business, I can handle it.
            </p>
