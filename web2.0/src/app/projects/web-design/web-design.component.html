        <h2>Kale Box Weekly</h2>
        <p>
            This project was part of Thomas Wallace's "Mobile Web" course. In this course, Thomas taught us how to design websites in a "Mobile First" way. For the modern web, mobile interfaces are increasingly important to accomodate, and styling for these devices first saves a lot of time and trouble coding for the desktop site using media queries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular project, Thomas had us come up with a business and design a website for it using Mobile First styling and structure. <a >Here is a link to the finished Figma Wireframe</a>. Below you can view the full spread of pages.

        <h2>EAST Initiative Website Redesign</h2>
        <p>
            I created this wireframe for Kevin Cate's "Web Design" class. This course was taught with a focus on the Graphic Designing element of building websites. We explored how to place content in a way that was eye catching and simultaneously easily usable.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this specific project, we were tasked with redesigning the entire website of an existing non-profit business. I chose to redesign eastinitiative.org. I tried to keep the original intention of the design while modifying elements such as the color palette and the layout for a fresh look.
