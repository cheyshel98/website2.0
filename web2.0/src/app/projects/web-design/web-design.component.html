        <h2>Kale Box Weekly</h2>
        <p>
            This project was part of Thomas Wallace's Mobile Web course at UA Little Rock. In this course, Thomas taught us how to design websites utilizing Mobile First coding practices. In the modern web mobile interfaces are important to accommodate. Styling for these smaller devices first saves a lot of time and troubleshooting when expanding styles to desktop sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular project, Thomas had us come up with a business and design a website for it utilizing the Mobile First approach. <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/eSGJcaBeWDJpCpa4wmcziNAu/Kale-Box-Weekly-Mobile?node-id=0-1&t=ACVZhU9juW7qsoDG-1" target="_blank" class="inline-link" >Here is a link to the finished Figma Wireframe</a>.

        <h2>EAST Initiative Website Redesign</h2>
        <p>
            I created this wireframe for Kevin Cate's "Web Design" class. This course was taught with a focus on the Graphic Designing element of building websites. We explored how to place content in a way that was eye catching and simultaneously easily usable.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this specific project, we were tasked with redesigning the entire website of an existing non-profit business. I chose to redesign <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.eastinitiative.org" target="_blank">eastinitiative.org</a>. I tried to keep the original intention of the design while modifying elements such as the color palette and the layout for a fresh look.
