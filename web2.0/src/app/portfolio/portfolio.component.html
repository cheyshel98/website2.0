            The website you are currently viewing was created by me using Angular v18. I wrote custom SCSS, HTML, and TypeScript
            which are available to view on my <a class="inline-link link-color-sec" href="https://github.com/cheyshel98/website2.0.git" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This site utilizes mobile-first design and can be used on phones with screens
            as small as 320 pixels wide. In addition to mobile support, this website is also fully accessible by keyboard and colors
            were chosen to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for visual accessibility.
